# Smart-contract

Decentralised app - accomodation booking system.

## Business model

There are two parties participating in this business: the owner of the houses who wants to rent them and the client who wants to book the accomodation. Bookings are handled by using Ethereum and smart-contract enables this process. A client, who wants to book a house, must have an ethereum account.

There was also created a minimalistic design front-end to establish simple intefrace for the client so he could easily book a house with just a few clicks on the screen.
